Hello Andrey! (Probably no one other will read this message :) )

It's my solution for Problem Set 5 of  "MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" course.

I have only one doubt - whether we don't violate "Honour Code" or something like that by giving public access to the solution. I did it when the deadline had expired and there are a lot of such repositories, but nevertheless.
